						<p>Dr Manjunath or Kounte sir as we fondly call him, is a terrific human being, close friend, mentor and an inspiration. Hailing from similar backgrounds, Dr Kounte has excelled in his teaching career at a quick pace. His single minded dedication, never say die attitude, frankness and open to ideas, makes the perfect recipe for a steadfast academician. We all look forward to talks with him, always fresh with ideas. He can look through situations and show us the bright side. He is always approachable and dependable.
                        Having guided many students, nudging them to publish papers, the professor is living it all. I wish him many more years of success at academics and an everlasting association in the years to come"</p>

						<p>"Manjunath Kounte sir have a great teaching style in which he use stuff from different sources and combine them into a simplified version which will help us in easier ‘digestion’ of the knowledge. He is friendly and understanding teacher, which would help us communicate with him better. He motivates students to unfold the hidden talents in them. He motivated me to go into research domain. With his immense support, he made me to publish two international papers. He has guided me throughout my B.Tech life and was a major reason for me to get placed in two companies. Thank you for everything sir. Very proud to be your student sir!"</p>

						<h3>Network engineer, CenturyLink India</h3>
						<p>"There are times in a  student's Life where you feel that you are lost, directionless, demotivated, distracted and nothing's working and during time like that all you need a ray of hope to guide. I was fortunate enough to have Kounte sir as my  mentor, teacher to guide and teach me through all the tough times during my student Life. He is one of the rare individual who understands the limitations of a student's view and always strives to unlock the perspective of greater possibility. </br>
                        He is technically sound and the range of topics he covers in depth in a single class is self-explanatory on his excellent teaching skill. I always liked attending his classes and labs as his teaching style was unorthodox and gave a practical and applicational insights. Even to this day I sometimes seek his guidance. Kudos to a great teacher!"</p>

						<h3>2019 Batch</h3>
						<p>Thanks for being an inspiring lecturer. He guides everyone in a best possible way. His way of motivation is unmatchable. 
Sir have paved me the way of research. He is a great resource. He helped me discover my research skills. I've never got a chance to listen to his classes. But I feel previlaged enough with the fact that I'm doing my project under his guidance. I have learnt a lot many things from him which are not just in academics but can be inculcated in life too. He taught us the value of time (which we would have wasted otherways). Lot many thanks for everything sir..</p>

						<p>I have been very fortunate to be your student sir. You have always encouraged me to participate in each and every activity conducted.

						<h3>2019 Batch</h3>
						<p>I take this opportunity to express my gratitude for everything he has done. Firstly sir have always been a great motivation. He is a person whom we can look up to for inspiration. The way he simplifies the things and bring them down is commendable. </br></br>
                         <strong>He is a lord of patience</strong>. I have never seen a teacher (that  too a person who teaches subjects like signals and systems) being so patient. He has enhanced my writing skills and presentation skills. He taught me to look the things in a different way. Without my knowledge I've started  researching on everything I see.</p>

						<h3>2018 Batch</h3>
						<p>Dr.Manjunath Kounte, rather I would love to call him Dr.cool. He is the one with immensely cool attitude all the time. He always thinks from student point of view, that is what makes him one of the most loved faculty in the University. He has a very unorthodox yet the most efficient teaching methodology that has helped him in bagging "The Best Teacher of the Year Award" several times. As we know "To be young forever you have to keep learning forever" and I believe this is the reason Dr.cool is a constant learner and forever student. Whatever new he learns he use to share with us all the time in class. Finally he is one the coolest and modest person I have ever met.</p>
